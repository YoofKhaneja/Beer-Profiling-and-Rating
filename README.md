The Beer Profile and Ratings dataset from Kaggle was used for the project. The main data set (beer_profile_and_ratings.csv) contains the following columns: \
(General) \
•	Name: Beer name (label) \

•	Brewery: Brewery name \
•	Beer Name: Complete beer name (Brewery + Brew Name) \
•	Description: Notes on the beer if available \
•	ABV: Alcohol content of beer (% by volume) \
•	Min IBU: The minimum IBU value each beer can possess \
•	Max IBU: The maximum IBU value each beer can possess \
(Mouth feel) \
•	Astringency \
•	Body \
•	Alcohol \
(Taste) \
•	Bitter \
•	Sweet \
•	Sour \
•	Salty \

2. Objectives and Motivation

The main objectives we hope to accomplish with this project are as follows: \
•	Understand the influence of the profile parameters on the review parameters \
•	Find the if there are any parameters that are more important than the others \
•	Find the relationship between the profile parameters \
•	Identify the most/least popular styles of beer \
\\
As a consumer, knowing what each beer feels like and what other people think about it would make one make better decisions while choosing a drink, or make it easier to explore new options.
\\
As a manufacturer, knowing what the people prefer and what they are talking about the most would help produce better, more desirable products for the market.
\\
Even though this is just a small example, the concepts used here can be used (and improved upon) to do real-world analysis on much larger data as well. \
